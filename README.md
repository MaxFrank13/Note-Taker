## Usage

Click the 'Get Started' button on the homepage. You will be presented with a blank page with the option to fill in two text inputs. One for 'Note Title' and the other for 'Note Text'. Once both fields have been typed into, a save icon will appear in the top right corner of the screen. Clicking this save button will save your inputs to a note. Each saved note is listed on the left side of the screen. Any previously saved notes can be accessed by clicking on them. Each item also has its own trash can icon which can be clicked to delete it from the list.
